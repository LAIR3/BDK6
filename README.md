# An extension of the the Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package to create layer 3 Blockchain Deployment Kit

A [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) package that deploys a private, portable, and modular [Polygon CDK](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/) devnet over [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Specifically, this package will deploy:

1. A local L1 chain, fully customizable with multi-client support, using the [ethereum-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package).
2. A local L2 chain, using the [Polygon Chain Development Kit](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/) (CDK), with customizable components such as sequencer, sequence sender, aggregator, rpc, prover, dac, etc. It will first deploy the [Polygon zkEVM smart contracts](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts) on the L1 chain before deploying the different components.
3. The [zkEVM bridge](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-bridge-service) infrastructure to facilitate asset bridging between the L1 and L2 chains, and vice-versa.
4. The [Agglayer](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer-go), an in-development interoperability protocol, that allows for trustless cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, as well as more complex operations between L2 chains, secured by zk proofs.
5. [Additional services](docs/additional-services.md) such as transaction spammer, monitoring tools, permissionless nodes etc.

> 🚨 This package is currently designed as a **development tool** for testing configurations and scenarios within the Polygon CDK stack. **It is not recommended for long-running or production environments such as testnets or mainnet**. If you need help, you can [reach out to the Polygon team](https://polygon.technology/interest-form) or [talk to an Implementation Partner (IP)](https://ecosystem.polygon.technology/spn/cdk/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To begin, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (>= [v4.27.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4270) for Mac users) and [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/).

If you intend to interact with and debug the stack, you may also want to consider a few additional optional tools such as:

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [yq](https://pypi.org/project/yq/) (v3)
- [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [polycli](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-cli)

### Deploy

Once that is good and installed on your system, you can run the following command to deploy the complete CDK stack locally. The default deployment includes zkevm-contracts ([fork 9](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc.1-fork.9)), [cdk-erigon](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/cdk-erigon) as the sequencer, and [cdk-node](https://github.com/0xPolygon/cdk) functioning as the sequence sender and aggregator. This process typically takes around eight to ten minutes.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

![CDK Erigon Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram/cdk-erigon-architecture-diagram.png)

It is also possible to deploy the CDK stack using the legacy zkevm-node sequencer and/or the new zkevm or the legacy zkevm-node sequencer sender and aggregator by modyfing the configuration file `params.yml`.

For example, the CDK stack can be alternatively deployed using zkevm-contracts ([fork 9](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc.1-fork.9)), with the legacy [zkevm-node](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node) serving as the sequencer, sequence sender and aggregator.

```bash
yq -Y --in-place '.deploy_cdk_erigon_node = false' params.yml
yq -Y --in-place '.args.sequencer_type = "zkevm"' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

</details>

### Interact

Let's do a simple L2 RPC test call.

First, you will need to figure out which port Kurtosis is using for the RPC. You can get a general feel for the entire network layout by running the following command:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect cdk-v1
```

That output, while quite useful, might also be a little overwhelming. Let's store the RPC URL in an environment variable. Note that you may need to adjust the various commands slightly if you deployed the legacy [zkevm-node](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node) as the sequencer. You should target the `zkevm-node-rpc-001` service instead of `cdk-erigon-node-001`.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL="$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 cdk-erigon-node-001 http-rpc)"
```

That is the same environment variable that `cast` uses, so you should now be able to run this command. Note that the steps below will assume you have the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed.

```bash
cast block-number
```

By default, the CDK is configured in `test` mode, which means there is some pre-funded value in the admin account with address `0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970`.

```bash
cast balance --ether 0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970
```

Okay, let’s send some transactions...

```bash
export PK="0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625"
cast send --legacy --private-key "$PK" --value 0.01ether 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Okay, let’s send even more transactions... Note that this step will assume you have [polygon-cli](https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-cli) installed.

```bash
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 50000 --rate-limit 50 --concurrency 5 --mode t
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 10 --mode 2
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 3  --mode uniswapv3
```

Pretty often, you will want to check the output from the service. Here is how you can grab some logs:

```bash
kurtosis service logs cdk-v1 agglayer --follow
```

In other cases, if you see an error, you might want to get a shell in the service to be able to poke around.

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk-v1 contracts-001
jq . /opt/zkevm/combined.json
```

One of the most common ways to check the status of the system is to make sure that batches are going through the normal progression of [trusted, virtual, and verified](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/concepts/transaction-finality/):

```bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber
```

If the number of verified batches is increasing, then it means the system works properly.

To access the `zkevm-bridge` user interface, open this URL in your web browser.

```bash
open "$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-bridge-proxy-001 web-ui)"
```

When everything is done, you might want to clean up with this command which stops the local devnet and deletes it.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
```

The LAIR3-BDK6 Layer 3 Blockchain Development Kit is designed to facilitate the deployment and management of advanced blockchain solutions specifically supporting zkEVM Rollup and Validium technologies. Merging the best of the Kurtosis SDK, polygon-cli, avalanche subnet-evm and ignite with Starlark the Blockchain Deployment Kit facilitates the creation and deployment of customized blockchain environments with enhanced observability and testing capabilities.

The primary goal is to to make blockchain deployment a sane operation accessiable to regular developers interested in dapplications development.
